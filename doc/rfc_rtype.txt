RFC                    Network protocol for RType           January 2018


1  Introduction

   The protocol defined in this document specifies the communication
   between the game server, and the game client.

1.1  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].


2  Network protocol

2.1 Server to client

2.1.1 Before joining a game room


   Upon connection from the client, the server shall send a list of game
   rooms to the newly connected client, using UDP. Each room information
   must contain a command ID (one, on one byte), two-bytes signed room
   ID, a one-byte player count, and a null byte terminated string of
   ASCII characters corresponding to the room name followed by 4 null
   byte terminated strings of ASCII characters corresponding to the
   players names (1st is the blue payer, 2nd is the red player, 3rd is
   the yellow player, 4th is the green player). After receiving the
   client's choice, the server must send the command ID (two, on one
   byte), and the chosen two-bytes ID. On error, the server must send
   the -1 value as one byte, optionally followed by an error message.


2.1.2 During a game

   Undefined, to change. The server must send a continuous stream of
   objects positions through a UDP connection. Each position shall be
   composed of the command ID (one, on one byte), a two-bytes ID, two
   two-bytes integers (object position, y then x), and a state (one
   byte, 1= intact, 2 = damaged, 3 = on fire, 4 = exploding).
   Optionally, in the event of a newly joined or disconnected client,
   the server must send, over a TCP connection, an ASCII string
   containing "[username] has joined.\n" or "[username] has quit.\n".

2.2 Client to server

2.2.1 Before joining a game room

   In order to choose a room, the client must send the command ID (one,
   on one byte), the two-bytes ID of the room followed by the password
   of the room (can be empty) and his username in a null byte terminated
   string of ASCII characters. For creating a room, the client must send
   the command ID (two, on one byte), the name of the room in a null
   byte terminated string of ASCII characters followed by the password
   of the room (can be empty) followed by his username.


2.2.2 During a game

   The client must send the actions of the player through the UDP
   connection. Each action must be an unsigned byte:
   1 = LEFT
   2 = RIGHT
   3 = UP
   4 = DOWN
   5 = SHOOT

   Each action must be sent as long as the key is pressed, at least
   every 10 milliseconds.
